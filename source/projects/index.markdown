Adidas Golden Boot Challenge
-------------------
<img src="/images/projects/golden-boot-challenge.png" class="post-image-right" alt="Addidas Golden Boot Challenge" />

The Golden Boot Challenge was a project that provided real-time, interactive second screen gaming experience based on Footbal matches.
Users would answer questions relating to the game during the matches and predict the outcomes - "will he score the penalty?".
The responses were aggregate, scored and shown to all users in real-time. Awesome mix of tech and an amazing product that Adidas used for their Euro 2012.

[Twibbon.com](http://twibbon.com) is the easiest and most powerful way to promote awareness of your cause on Twitter and Facebook. Started as a storm idea by @movingforwards and @brianbbrian, evolved into a hugely popular site with high levels of traffic. Twibbon is one of the key projects I work on at @stormideas.

The service overlays a small icon onto supporters’ profile images to create a ‘Twibbon’, making a visual, impactful online statement.

<img src="/images/projects/whoisxmlapi.png" class="post-image-right" alt="Google Analytics Controls" />
Started an Open Source library to provide graphs based on the live data from Google Analytics.

Google Analytics Controls provide highly flexible and re-usable charting, grid, dropdown and custom treeselect controls based on the analytics data.

Google Analytics lets any user export the analytics data via the API. The controls are build on the standard .Net controls with utilisation of Microsoft Chart Controls for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Google GData, MS Charts, Moq framework and NUnit. The power of MS Charts gives you a full control over the visual presentation of the data in design time, while the analytics data is only used to create the data series and points.
