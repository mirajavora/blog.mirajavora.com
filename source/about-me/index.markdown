Principal software engineer with a strong focus on web-based applications, I'm interested in agile development methods and test-driven development. Excited by solving problems and a fan of big data.

A strong background in .NET (C#), JAVA and HTML/CSS/JS, I've been recently spending most of my time with Scala, JAVA, Couchbase, Elastic Search and Apache Kafka.

My past projects also included PHP, RavenDB, Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, MSMQ and more
