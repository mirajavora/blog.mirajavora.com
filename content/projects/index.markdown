{{< figure src="/images/projects/golden-boot-challenge.png" class="list__thumbnail thumbnail" alt="Addidas Golden Boot Challenge"  >}}

The Golden Boot Challenge was a project that provided real-time, interactive second screen gaming experience based on Footbal matches.
Users would answer questions relating to the game during the matches and predict the outcomes - "will he score the penalty?".
The responses were aggregate, scored and shown to all users in real-time. Awesome mix of tech and an amazing product that Adidas used for their Euro 2012.
